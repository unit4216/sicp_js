  A grocery store has a list of price deltas for the upcoming week, in order to find the biggest negative deltas (i.e. price drops) they sort the list of deltas
  and use these for ads etc.
1.1-2
  Fuel efficiency i.e. going the farthest distance with the least fuel via driving methods.
1.1-3
  A list, it's very simple and easy to manipulate but it's simplicity is also a limitation as opposed to dictionary/JSON/object format.
1.1-4
  They are similar in that they seek the most efficient/shortest path but shortest-path just seeks the shortest path between A and B
  for one traveler while the salesman problem seeks the shortest path for each traveler in a group of multiple given a number of 
  total stops i.e. the start and endpoint for each traveler is defined but not the middle points whereas in the first problem you have
  all points on the path defined (start and end).
1.1-5
  An algorithm which starts a car, for instance, has to use the best solution because there is a binary state of either the car is started or it's not,
  and if the car isn't started the algorithm is useless.  On the other hand, an algorithm for catching fish doesn't have to be perfect because
  catching 98/100 fish is still a lot of fish and a good haul.

  Google Maps, algorithms for shortest distance, algorithms to parse user input, algorithms for rendering etc.
